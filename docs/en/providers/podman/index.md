# Podman provider

Podman is a first-class compute provider. cautem discovers a Podman API
socket and reuses the Docker Engine client path (`driver.OpenEngine("podman")`).
Sandbox labels, networks, proxy sidecar, and exec flows match Docker.

## Activate

```bash
export CAUTEM_DRIVER=podman
# optional:
# export CAUTEM_PODMAN_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock

cautem status    # driver: podman
```

## Private registries

Run `podman login registry.example` before creating a sandbox. Pulls use the
matching entry from `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE`, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/containers/auth.json`,
or `~/.config/containers/auth.json`, in that order. Set the Podman compute
driver's `registry_auth_file` to use another authfile. If no matching Podman
entry exists, cautem falls back to the Docker CLI credential config. Credentials
are sent only with the image-pull request and are not copied into the sandbox.

For inspected HTTPS endpoints signed by a private CA, set `egress_ca_bundle`
in the Podman compute-driver configuration to a PEM bundle. It extends system
trust while preserving certificate and hostname verification. `proxy_ca_bundle`
is separate and trusts the HTTPS forward proxy itself. Recreate the sandbox
proxy after CA rotation.

For rootless Podman installations where UID/GID mappings can change,
`reconcile_data_ownership` may be enabled in the compute-driver configuration.
For sandboxes with persistent data, startup then reassigns entries in the
dedicated `/cautem/data` volume to the sandbox user. It is off by default,
can take time on large volumes, and does not touch the workspace bind mount.

Resource flags, log rotation, slim proxy image, and soft defaults behave the
same as on Docker — see [Docker resources](../docker/resources.md) and
[Docker logging](../docker/logging.md).
